Software Engineering Practices and Process Models

 Chosen Process Model: Agile with XP (Extreme Programming) Practices
Why Agile?

The system requires iterative refinement (e.g., adapting AI models, improving proctoring UX).

Feedback from stakeholders (teachers, students) is essential.

Continuous updates for security and cheating detection.

XP Practices Used:

Pair Programming (for critical AI components)

Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Continuous Integration (CI)

Refactoring (especially for scalability and modularity)

ðŸ”¹ Agile Ceremonies & Artifacts
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks

Daily Standups: 15 minutes

Sprint Planning: Backlog grooming + defining sprint goals

Retrospectives: Improve process each iteration

Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burn-down Charts
